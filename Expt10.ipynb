The acronym RSA comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977.\n","The idea! The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer.\n","The public key consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers and private key is also derived from the same two prime numbers.\n","So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit keys could be broken in the near future.

The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer.\n","The public key consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers and private key is also derived from the same two prime numbers.\n","So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit keys could be broken in the near future. But till now it seems to be an infeasible task.\n","Bob decrypts the signature using public key of Alice RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission.\n","It is also one of the oldest.
